Consequently, an NG (No Grade) is awarded for the overall project. (Reference: Rules and Regulations / Section 5 / page: 0).\\n\\n2. **Mandatory Attendance**: All project meetings and assessment moments are mandatory. While one project meeting may be missed without consequences, missing two or more meetings can lead to not being allowed to take the exam for that project phase, resulting in a grade of zero for that phase. (Reference: Rules and Regulations / Section 5 / page: 0).\\n\\n3. **Force Majeure Consideration**: The regulations state that arrangements allowing for missed project meetings and skill classes should only be used in cases of clear force majeure. If you believe your situation qualifies as such, it may be worth discussing with your project coordinator. (Reference: Rules and Regulations / Section 5 / page: 8).\\n\\nGiven your circumstances, I recommend reaching out to your project coordinator first to explain your situation and provide any documentation you have (like a doctor's note). They may be able to guide you on the next steps or advocate on your behalf to the Board of Examiners if necessary. \\n\\nIf you have further questions or need clarification, please refer to the specific articles in the Rules and Regulations or consult your project coordinator for assistance.\""
