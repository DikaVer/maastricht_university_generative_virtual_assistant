      "Q: I had to be about 35 minutes late for today's project meeting due to religious reasons. I'm a Muslim, and so I had to attend the mandatory Friday prayers at the mosque, which is on the other side of Maastricht from our campus, which made me late for the project meeting. I've been noted down as absent from the meeting and told to email you. I also emailed you about the same problem last week (since the last project meeting was also on Friday), and I had received no response, so please let me know if I won't be penalized for both project meetings. Thank you for your time.\n",
      "A: Project Meetings are mandatory on site sessions. If you’re not present when the tutors checks the attendance, then you do not get the attendance. You now have 2 missed project meetings in Phase 3, which means that you receive an automatically lowered individual grade, which will be determined by the examiners.\n",

      "The Board of Examiners can excuse students from the participation in project meetings in individual cases due to personal circumstances and can offer repair opportunities for the project as a whole. The student must in such cases prove force majeure for all mandatory meeting that the student missed, see also Article 3.7 of the Rules and Regulations. Deviation from the group grade is possible in such cases. The Board of Examiners can also grant resits for projects in special circumstances. Since the project is an onsite group activity, students must be within commuting distance from Maastricht during each project activity.\n",
      "All project meetings are mandatory. One project meeting may be missed each block of the three blocks of a semester, without consequences, as an arrangement to cover force majeure and may only be used as such. If two or more meetings are missed in the first or second block of the semester, the student will not have access to the exam of that project phase and that phase will count as grade zero. If two meetings are missed in the third block of the semester, the student will automatically receive a lowered individual grade. If three or more meetings are missed in the third block of the semester, the student will not have access to the exam of that project phase and that phase will count as grade zero.\n",
      "On-campus attendance and participation in the project meetings and project skills trainings, is mandatory, see Article 4.4 of the EER. Missing a meeting or training in this article means failure to be present during part of or the complete meeting or training, inadequate participation or inadequately completing the assignments. For project meetings the project tutor or project coordinator decides whether a student missed it or not, and for the skill trainings the lecturer or project coordinator.\n",
      "Projects are group work and all students are expected to actively participate. Students whose behaviour is still detrimental after receiving a formal warning can be expelled from the project and receive an NG. They are not allowed to take a project resit.\n",
      "The requirements in paragraph 1 are requirements as in article 7.13(2)(t) of the act. A student who has not met the requirements as stated in paragraph 1, cannot participate in the examination of the project and will receive an NG. More information can be found in the Rules and Regulations.\n",
      "Participation in project skill trainings is taken into account in the final grading. If a student has missed three or more skills trainings, the student will not be able to participate in the final examination of the project, meaning that an NG is given for the project. This NG will also be awarded if after the final examination it turns out that a student that was ineligible still participated.\n",

This could potentially lead to the course being listed as failed on the student portal. It is important to ensure that all aspects of the project, including participation in presentations, are completed as required to avoid discrepancies in the final course grade.

To be clear: An email claiming illness is not considered proof. b. If it is possible to avoid a problem from occurring by e.g. requesting to reschedule a meeting, the student is obliged to do so.

Deviation from the group grade is possible in such cases. The Board of Examiners can also grant resits for projects in special circumstances. Since the project is an onsite group activity, students must be within commuting distance from Maastricht during each project activity. For students who have not met the project requirements by insufficient participation in project meetings, skill trainings, project presentations, the product and report examination (if applicable) and any other mandatory meetings, the modification to the student’s grade as indicated in Article 5.4 and in Article 5.6.3 will be applied after the individual grading of the student.']\n",

      " As coordinator and skill class teacher, I can only take note of attendance/submission. If you did not submit your skill class assignment, you receive a fail on the skill class. What you can do, is email the BoE to ask claim a force majeure (and then they might give you a repair assignment to fix the failed skill class). Regarding your presence in the assessment moments, the rules and regulations state the following: “Failure to participate in the final project presentation means that the student cannot be graded for the presentation and the grade for the rubrics concerning the presentation will count as 0. If a student does not participate in the product and report examination (if applicable), or misses in total two or more of the aforementioned assessment moments, there is insufficient bases for assessing the individual contribution of the student, with the consequence that an NG is awarded for the overall project of the student involved.” This means that if you would miss both examinations, you would receive an NG. However, I think that because you are sick you have a claim. Make sure to also mention this in your email to the BoE.

      "Let’s make the following clear first: The pre-examination counts as a project meeting. If you miss 2 project meetings in Phase 3, you receive an automatically lowered individual grade. If you miss 3 or more project meetings in Phase 3, then you receive a zero on Phase 3. You now have 2 missed project meetings. If you believe you could not be present during both instances (the project meeting and the pre-examination) due to force majeure, then you can argue that to the BoE. If they decide in your favor, then you will be exempted from both meetings, but the examiners will still investigate whether a lowered individual grade is appropriate (but it’s no longer automatic).\n",

      "A: Based on the rules and regulations provided, if you miss the pre-exam and one meeting due to your nerve issues and recovery, you may be able to request an excusal from the Board of Examiners based on force majeure. It is important to provide proof of your situation to the Board of Examiners. Missing the pre-exam may affect your skill points, so it's crucial to communicate with your group members and possibly the project tutor or coordinator about your situation. Additionally, you may be eligible for a resit for the missed project phase if your grade is 4.0 or more. Make sure to inform the examiners about your situation promptly and follow the guidelines for resits as outlined in the regulations.

      " Can you clarify what you mean with “hasn’t participated in any part of the project at all”? Especially in combination with the who did what. The who did what forms are considered the “ground truth” for the examiners as this a document agreed upon by the group. This means that we cannot change the distribution as reported in the who did what’s of Phase 1 and 2. I advise you strongly to be as honest as possible in the Phase 3 version of the who did what. The examiners will pick this up during the product and report examination. Usually this results in an individual grade for the person in question (this could be a failing grade). The rules and regulations state that the project is team work and therefore everyone should contribute actively. If not, the coordinator (that’s me) can issue a formal warning to the person in question. If the person does not change their behavior after the formal warning they are kicked out of the project and receive an NG. What you can therefore do, is make a work distribution for the coming days that you all agree upon. The work distribution is a table with your names in the rows and as columns “who”, “what”, “by when”, and “acceptable outcome”. You email this table to all your team mates and me and the counsellors. I can than issue a formal warning.\n",

      "Project Meetings are mandatory on site sessions. If you miss 2 (two) project meetings in Phase 3, you receive an automatically lowered individual grade. If you miss 3 (three) or more project meetings in Phase 3, you receive a zero for the phase. So, in principle, as long as you miss only project meeting, there’s no issue. However, it is smart to keep proof of your illness in case you need to prove force majeure with the BoE. (Just your statement does not count, but a doctor’s note or something like that would.)\n",

      "Q: Due to unforeseen weather conditions in Romania, my scheduled flight on Sunday was canceled. As a result, I had to make alternative arrangements and took another flight today in order to fulfill my commitments. Regrettably, this unexpected change in travel plans resulted in my inability to attend today's group meeting as planned. I understand the importance of my presence and contribution to these meetings, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience my absence may have caused.

I am committed to ensuring that my responsibilities are fulfilled promptly despite these unforeseen challenges. Please let me know if there is any additional information required from my end to support this request. I appreciate your assistance and understanding in this matter. I look forward to catching up and contributing to the team's endeavors in our next meeting.\n",
      "A: Based on the rules and regulations provided, your situation of the canceled flight due to unforeseen weather conditions in Romania could potentially be considered as force majeure, which is an example of hardship that might be taken into consideration by the Board of Examiners. In such cases, it is important to properly motivate your request and provide proof for the circumstances that occurred, as per the regulations. You should file your request as soon as possible, within two weeks after the event occurred, and ensure that you have valid documentation to support your claim.\n",

To be clear: An email claiming illness is not considered proof. b. If it is possible to avoid a problem from occurring by e.g. requesting to reschedule a meeting, the student is obliged to do so. The resit is a repair opportunity, and the method shall be determined by the examiners. Repair opportunities can be individual or on a group level, where changes will be permitted to the composition of the original project group. Students who were expelled from the project or did not receive a grade in the current academic year are not allowed to take the project resit. A repair opportunity will only be offered if the grade is 4.0 or more (hence an NG is ineligible for a resit) to ensure that a student has obtained sufficient practical training. The student(s) will receive the resit assignment from the examiners within 2 working days after failing the project. This additional assignment must be handed in within 10 working days. If completed successfully, the student will receive a 6.0 for the project. The requirements in paragraph 1 are requirements as in article 7.13(2)(t) of the act. A student who has not met the requirements as stated in paragraph 1, cannot participate in the examination of the project and will receive an NG.

      "Project Meetings are mandatory on site sessions. You have to be physically present to obtain the attendance check. Hence, you do not have the attendance for the first project meetings. Note that in Phase 2 you receive an automatically lowered individual grade if you miss two project meetings. (The reduction is determined by the examiners.) If you miss 3 or more project meetings, then you receive a zero for the Phase 3 grade (which counts for 70% in the project grade). You currently have 1 missed project meeting. Make sure you don’t miss any other meetings. (Note that the pre-examination also counts as a project meeting.) Say you would miss another project meeting, it’s important to document everything. Make sure you have proof of the unforeseen weather conditions and the canceled flight and the dates of the new flight. This is important in case you have to proof force majeure to the BoE in case of a second missed project meeting.\n",
