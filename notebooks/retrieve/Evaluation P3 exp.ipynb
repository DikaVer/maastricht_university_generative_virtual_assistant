I'm a Muslim, and so I had to attend the mandatory Friday prayers at the mosque, which is on the other side of Maastricht from our campus, which made me late for the project meeting. I've been noted down as absent from the meeting and told to email you. I also emailed you about the same problem last week (since the last project meeting was also on Friday), and I had received no response, so please let me know if I won't be penalized for both project meetings. Thank you for your time.\n",
