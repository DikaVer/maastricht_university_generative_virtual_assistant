The examiners will pick this up during the product and report examination. Usually this results in an individual grade for the person in question (this could be a failing grade). The rules and regulations state that the project is team work and therefore everyone should contribute actively. If not, the coordinator (that’s me) can issue a formal warning to the person in question. If the person does not change their behavior after the formal warning they are kicked out of the project and receive an NG. What you can therefore do, is make a work distribution for the coming days that you all agree upon.

Their email address is dacs-counsellors@maastrichtuniversity.nl.'},\n {'input': \"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that, regrettably, I will be unable to attend the mandatory project meeting scheduled for this coming Tuesday. Due to health-related reasons, I have been advised by my healthcare provider not to travel until the completion of my ongoing treatment. I'd like to know if this absence, due to unexpected circumstances, will be considered as a missed meeting or if there's an option for alternative arrangements. I assure you of my commitment to the project and am prepared to take necessary steps to ensure I am up-to-date with any information discussed or tasks assigned during the meeting. Please let me know if there's any additional information required from my end.\",\n  'output': 'Project meetings are mandatory on site sessions. If you’re not present physically, then you do not get the attendance check. It is wise to support your team via video conferencing, but you will not get the attendance. In Phase 3, you receive an automatically lowered individual grade if you miss 2 project meetings. The lowering is determined by the examiners so I can’t say anything about that. If you miss 3 project meetings, you get a zero for Phase 3 which usually means you fail the phase because Phase 3 counts for 70% in the project grade. If you only miss one project meeting, then in principle there’s no issue. You can attempt to request an exemption from the board of examiners, but I don’t think it’s necessary for now if you only miss one project meeting.'},\n {'input': 'I wanted to ask you a question related to the project meetings and the pre-examination. Two days ago, I had a surgery on my toe in my home country and even though I got discharged, it is recommended to me to visit the hospital every day for monitoring and dressings for the next one or two weeks(depending on my physical condition). My question is, if I show proof about the surgery and the recovery, can I participate in the project meetings and in the pre-examination online instead of on site?',\n  'output': 'Project Meetings are mandatory on site sessions, as per rules and regulations.

If there’s no way for you to be here, you can join via video conferencing, but you will not get the attendance.'},\n {'input': \"So to clarify even with my undergoing medical issue, I can't be exempted from attending project meetings on site? Also doesn't my case count as force majeure? Additionally, I want to ask if I don't have attendance for two projects meetings, by how much is my grade lowered?\",\n  'output': ' You can attempt to argue a force majeure to the BoE in order to get an exemption for the affected project meetings. (I do not decide whether or not something is force majeure, that’s the BoE’s responsibility.) I’m not 100% sure if the BoE will exempt your case because it’s unclear if this was planned or unplanned surgery. If it was the former, you could have foreseen this issue and don’t think they will count it as a force majeure then, but you can try. If you do not get an exemption and you would miss 2 project meetings, your grade is automatically lowered. This is decided by the examiners, hence, I cannot say anything about how much it would be lowered.'},\n {'input': 'I wanted to ask a question regarding the Project Opening scheduled for Friday 7 October.

Definite.'},\n {'input': 'I wanted to ask a question regarding the Project Opening scheduled for Friday 7 October. What exactly will happen during the PO? Is this just a meeting where you will talk about the project or will we be taking part in activities with our groups? The reason I am asking this is because there are two different Maastricht – Luxembourg bus times on that day, one from 9.25-12.20 and the other 17:25-20:20. If I were to take the morning bus, I would have to miss my CS1 lecture which I don’t really want to do. Luckily we won’t be learning any new content on that day but we will be working individually on previous assignments. If I were to take the afternoon bus I would be able to listen to the online meeting or maybe even listen to a recording afterwards if worse comes to worst. However, if we will need to interact with our group members then it would be a better option for me to attend the PO in a more suitable environment.',\n  'output': ' During PO, we clarify organizational aspects, mention version control software, and introduce the topic.

Details can be found in the R&R#5.4, see excerpt: “All project meetings are mandatory. One project meeting may be missed each block of the three blocks of a semester, without consequences, as an arrangement to cover force majeure and may only be used as such. If two or more meetings are missed in the first or second block of the semester, the student will not have access to the exam of that project phase and that phase will count as grade zero. If two meetings are missed in the third block of the semester, the student will automatically receive a lowered individual grade.

The rules and regulations state that in Phase 3 a student will receive an automatically lowered individual grade if they miss 2 project meetings (and will be determined by the examiners so I can’t say how much that lowering would be).

The first meeting is exceptionally important. Note that Phase 3 is very short and you will have to work hard to get everything done.

We all agree that this temporary measure is in the best interest of my personal well-being and the overall success of the project. Please understand that this is not an attempt to evade my responsibilities. On the contrary, I am eager to contribute to the project, which has been a highlight of my university experience. I believe that by attending the meetings remotely, I can continue to contribute effectively and stay aligned with the project's goals.

Since, as shown in the screenshots in the previous email and this one, I have submitted both assignments. But especially, I’m writing about the Citing & References skills class. I submitted the pre-task on time at first, but I put the citation in a text entry box along uploading the rest as PDF files. So that citation line didn’t upload, and I wasn’t made aware of this until the grades were up and other people started having the same problem. As soon as I was made aware of the issue, I reuploaded everything as a PDF. Unfortunately, due to this, the assignment status says I was “late”. Therefore, I kindly ask you whether it would be possible to not put that skills class as missing, since it clearly was a glitch on canvas that the students weren’t made aware of.",

Therefore, I would like to request permission to attend the project meetings via Zoom during this period. My intention is to maintain my involvement and contribution to the project, ensuring that my temporary absence does not hinder our progress. I have discussed this arrangement with my teammates, and they have kindly expressed their support. We all agree that this temporary measure is in the best interest of my personal well-being and the overall success of the project. Please understand that this is not an attempt to evade my responsibilities. On the contrary, I am eager to contribute to the project, which has been a highlight of my university experience. I believe that by attending the meetings remotely, I can continue to contribute effectively and stay aligned with the project's goals.

I was given an update on the code from my group members, as well as told what tasks I am able to complete while I was away. If need be, I can provide proof of correspondence. Attached are the letters from the airline detailing the cancellation of my flight.

As the bus approached, I stand up so it sees me and stops, but the bus drove right past me, At this point, I panicked a little bit because the next bus would not let me reach on time as the commute to the faculty is a little over an hour long. I immediately booked an Uber to try and reach on time and waited almost 35 minutes for an Uber, but uber could not find a driver. I have a screenshot of this, I understand I have already used my force majeure and missed one meeting, but I genuinely tried to make the meeting, but nothing was working in my favor. Please tell me what I can do now.",
          "Due to unforeseen weather conditions in Romania, my scheduled flight on Sunday was canceled. As a result, I had to make alternative arrangements and took another flight today in order to fulfill my commitments. Regrettably, this unexpected change in travel plans resulted in my inability to attend today's group meeting as planned. I understand the importance of my presence and contribution to these meetings, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience my absence may have caused. Given the circumstances, I would like to request your understanding and support in providing a brief explanation or documentation to motivate my absence from today's meeting. I am committed to ensuring that my responsibilities are fulfilled promptly despite these unforeseen challenges. Please let me know if there is any additional information required from my end to support this request. I appreciate your assistance and understanding in this matter. I look forward to catching up and contributing to the team's endeavors in our next meeting.",

He doesn't work on any task, because he says that he is \"\"researching\"\".

I've been noted down as absent from the meeting and told to email you.

Is this just a meeting where you will talk about the project or will we be taking part in activities with our groups? The reason I am asking this is because there are two different Maastricht – Luxembourg bus times on that day, one from 9.25-12.20 and the other 17:25-20:20. If I were to take the morning bus, I would have to miss my CS1 lecture which I don’t really want to do. Luckily we won’t be learning any new content on that day but we will be working individually on previous assignments. If I were to take the afternoon bus I would be able to listen to the online meeting or maybe even listen to a recording afterwards if worse comes to worst. However, if we will need to interact with our group members then it would be a better option for me to attend the PO in a more suitable environment.",

I submitted the pre-task on time at first, but I put the citation in a text entry box along uploading the rest as PDF files. So that citation line didn’t upload, and I wasn’t made aware of this until the grades were up and other people started having the same problem. As soon as I was made aware of the issue, I reuploaded everything as a PDF. Unfortunately, due to this, the assignment status says I was “late”.

Due to a combination of financial limitations and the toll on my mental health from being far from home, I have decided to extend my stay with my family and will be returning to campus on January 14th. This period away is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity under the current circumstances. I am fully committed to the project and keenly aware of the importance of active participation in our meetings. Therefore, I would like to request permission to attend the project meetings via Zoom during this period. My intention is to maintain my involvement and contribution to the project, ensuring that my temporary absence does not hinder our progress. I have discussed this arrangement with my teammates, and they have kindly expressed their support. We all agree that this temporary measure is in the best interest of my personal well-being and the overall success of the project. Please understand that this is not an attempt to evade my responsibilities. On the contrary, I am eager to contribute to the project, which has been a highlight of my university experience. I believe that by attending the meetings remotely, I can continue to contribute effectively and stay aligned with the project's goals.

I was given an update on the code from my group members, as well as told what tasks I am able to complete while I was away. If need be, I can provide proof of correspondence. Attached are the letters from the airline detailing the cancellation of my flight. I was supposed to have arrived on the 9th before class, and due to the tropical storm, ended up having a cancelled flight and missing the meeting.

I have read the past announcements that reference this sort of situation and I hope you can understand since the alternative would entail two days of constant travel (due to no immediate flight existing) and a monetary investment of my family that they can't afford due to the difference in salaries between the two countries.
