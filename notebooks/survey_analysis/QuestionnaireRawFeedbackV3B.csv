20-6-2024 14:10:38,Maybe possibility of edit your already send question.,"I think the answers are too long. It does help, but it is always like it may result in something, but it depends. But if it really depends and you can not exactly tell then its okay, but I think the answers should be shorter."
20-6-2024 14:21:04,,answers are sometimes a bit repeteve a that is a little problem
20-6-2024 14:40:21,Being able to upload files or screenshot. Being able to copy the text answer so you can paste it somewhere else. ,
20-6-2024 14:52:24,"Possibly the ability to have more than one chat, or clear the cache of the current chat so that responses aren't constantly built up from the previous and may cause the virtual assistant to have some less than optimal responses","I like the answers from the bot, but from what I saw the conclusion of some of the prompts I asked are a bit vague. The conclusion usually was that the situation must be taken into account with the examiners, which is completely understandable.

One more thing that I think that could benefit the assistant is perhaps providing emails of the project coordinators. If there are some questions that the assistant can't properly answer, it could provide the user with the contact for the project coordinators so the user could contact his project coordinator for further questions. "
20-6-2024 15:02:08,"I would also like to see details about courses, what you should book for each period , I would also like to see details about exams and resits, as well as different opportunities you can get from the University (eg. websites that are free for Maastricht University students)",No. Overall I think it works pretty good and is a great idea. Great job! 
20-6-2024 15:16:02,Maybe names of who to contact (albeit this is probably a privacy violation),You cannot say that you asked the assistant and based on that made a wrong decision right? The AI is never completely true :(. But that is just ai being ai i guess 
20-6-2024 15:16:22,,this is saying things that are not true. maybe the datasets (upaded) and now are new rules. also is not direct enough and cant get you a straight answer. feels like gpt 3 :))
20-6-2024 15:36:43,"Less talk from the bot. Split the message into parts, like make it clear where is the answer or the conclusion and where is the explanation. Also, a link to the rule and regulation to where the sentense is been given would be good.",
20-6-2024 15:39:35,"what happens if I miss pre examination in phase 3 - I asked this and it started referring to missing phase 1 and phase 2 final presentations which is not a direct answer to the question I'm still not completely sure what happens if you miss the pre-examination,
overall some of the answers were too long and not direct enough.",
20-6-2024 16:07:25,,"I believe that the VA is avoiding the direct response to the questio, it is making some valid references to the rules book, but it is not answering directly the given question"
20-6-2024 16:11:07,,I think if u summarize the answer at the end it would better
20-6-2024 16:28:09,-,I would have liked shorter answers summarizing everything.
20-6-2024 16:32:48,It has to be a lot faster to be usable and give shorter more concrete answers.,
21-6-2024 12:57:42,none,show the result in the conclusion
21-6-2024 13:28:06,,
21-6-2024 13:30:12,"it works great, only one thing that could maybe be more useful is having a history or tabs within same window",
21-6-2024 13:43:23,"show how many skill classes the person has already miss, and also the same for the project meetings, so the student can know at every time that has lower grade",
21-6-2024 13:47:05,,
21-6-2024 14:02:43,"Instead of long answer, It would be better If I received shorter and more direct answers. Also, the responses I received were not useful at all. They didn't help my situation.",Nope
21-6-2024 14:07:00,"The options for what topic you want to discuss are great, but there should be a few more, because right now they don't cover all the most basic topics","No, thank you for working on this!"
21-6-2024 14:21:37,more situations which are more specific,some parts were maybe not fully detailed on what it was asking
21-6-2024 14:41:21,nothing comes to mind right now,"the answers could be a bit more concise, sometimes it feels like it says the same thing thrice before providing the answer needed. i feel like it's not really that necessary to explain what e.g. force majeure is if i didn't ask what it entails etc. but just answer what are the consequences/rules. i like that it provides clear references though."
21-6-2024 14:44:05,"providing email address for person you have to solve this problem, and maybe generate email its self by the information providing by the student",it is quite slow
21-6-2024 14:56:03,"an ability where you can paste questions in, i couldn't do so",how can you ensure trust and what if it makes mistakes? wouldn't it be easier to just have a PDF or a cnetralized location with clear definitions and scenarios than needing an assistant? and is this really taking up that much time of the coordinator?
21-6-2024 15:00:37,Nothing. It seems like it works very well,No i think it works very well
21-6-2024 15:54:03,feature idea: highlight the main points or bold them so that one can have a quick glance and then have the option to read more,It was is a nice assistant!
21-6-2024 16:03:19,information about how thesis works,I don`t know
