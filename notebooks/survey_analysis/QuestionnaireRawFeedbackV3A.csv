Tijdstempel,What functionality would you like to see added in a new version of the Virtual Assistant?,Do you have any other comments/questions about this questionnaire/Virtual Assistant?
20-6-2024 13:43:51,I would like to see functionality that you write your case and give the consequences and what to do in that situation    ,
20-6-2024 13:48:41,"More concise and to the point responses, less """"dancing around the answer""""",
20-6-2024 13:59:04,,I would rather have the answers be shorter
20-6-2024 13:59:48,"Maybe it would be helpful if it could direct students towards a way to contact coordinators, by giving their contacts",Its really helpful and easy to use i would definitely use it if i have questions
20-6-2024 14:12:03,"First state the exact answer, then follow up with all the details. Be able to remember your personal details and project history by logging in",
20-6-2024 14:20:51,Respond back when I greet him.,Nope
20-6-2024 14:36:25,Most frequently asked questions and quick links to the most important resources,
20-6-2024 14:43:39,To be more precise and not to give guidelines which are longer than whole rules and regulations ,
20-6-2024 15:00:26,"An extension for other universities, some contacts of the project coordinators, some motivational emojis . ",No
20-6-2024 15:08:56,make the reference clickable.,"i like the idea of helping students, but i find it kind of ridiculous that these rules and regulations are so complicated that we need an ai to understand them, which is not your fault at all! For the product itself, i found the answers a bit vague and too long. They should get straight to the point. Also the language was too formal for my taste (example from the responses: ""[...]as an arrangement to cover force majeure, and it is recommended to use this allowance judiciously"".)

Also it would be very cool to extend the product so that it also can handle other questions about university. For example the GPA which is needed for the honour's programme or for a semester abroad, how reparation assignments work for different courses, what to do if i don't have enough credits in the first year or what to do if i miss an exam due to a medical caused absence. "
20-6-2024 15:31:15,"When buildings are open, when do we have holidays, places you can go in exchange to, which professor taches which course, requirements to graduate cum laude/honors ecc","too long and general text produced, its difficult to find a final answer to the necessity. Be it more concise. "
20-6-2024 15:42:17,I do not know.,"a more personalized answer to the User could provide helpful. For example, the structure of the answers are very one-sided. Friendlier and more personalized answer could increase user satisfaction. (I imagine most people asking for rules & regulations are already in a stressful situation)"
20-6-2024 15:50:43,More simplified version of the answers,
20-6-2024 16:02:24,"I think this is a great idea! And works very nicely! I would like to see it applied to many aspects of UM like academics, job openings in the university, sports memberships... And overall any questions a student could have. This would also help the new coming students settle in easier","I would ask the chatbot to give more concise responses and shorter, since it would be easier to understand."
20-6-2024 16:15:06,maybe it would be nice to see some common questions and have a button to read rules directly(because bot uses citation),"Chat bot correctly defines the area of the question, but I feel lack of comparing with exact situation. So if the situation not literally stated in rules, it is hard to interpret the answer"
20-6-2024 16:22:08,Make it less wordy.,Actually know what to do. It kind of just gives us the rules and regulations. but a lot of the time those are vague.
21-6-2024 13:27:51,I don't know,No
21-6-2024 13:34:05,I think it will be grade so that in the assistant you can provide files that he can check if they are good to use as an excuse.,no
21-6-2024 13:43:19,less text,no
21-6-2024 13:43:40,shorter and more precise answers,no
21-6-2024 13:45:56,Maybe faster response time,no 
21-6-2024 14:02:18,,
21-6-2024 14:11:05,text should appear in a way similar to how chat gpt does it rather than all at once,
21-6-2024 14:13:56,the text writing as it loads like in chatgpt it looks cooler. also maybe that it gives the contacts of people we could contact after a certain question to get more info or maybe it sends us a link to the section of which rules and regulation its referencing.,no 
21-6-2024 14:20:32,,
21-6-2024 14:23:09,maybe add a feature to remind students of upcoming project meetings and examination moments and keep track of the missed meetings.,
21-6-2024 14:44:32,"shorter answers, maybe just answer simple questions in 5lines and develop to those detailed answers only if the student asks for it","looks good, but from what i see the answers are all things we can get from the manual i dont know if it goes further than that?"
21-6-2024 14:45:27,Help with course registration,Maybe the VA should summarize the answer in the beginning then give the full description in order to help the user save time
21-6-2024 14:51:32,"Maybe to summarize some answers at the end, because some answers are very long",
21-6-2024 15:01:28,"Shorter, more concise answers, maybe including bullet points.",
21-6-2024 15:18:50,,
21-6-2024 15:31:07,"I understand the nature of a chatbot but I think it would be great that either at the end or at the beginning of the response there was a clear/direct answer (with text in bold or similar), giving that many of the questions are quite concise and require the same type of answer in order to make decisions about it. This is just a suggestion.",It`s a really cool concept. I think it does to work fine. I really value the fact that it cites of the Rules and Regulations. Its a really great feature.
21-6-2024 15:32:04,everything is good,everything is good
